This repository contains Terraform configurations for managing AWS infrastructure as code.

## Prerequisites
- Terraform (version 1.5.0 or later)
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- An AWS account with required permissions

## Getting Started

1. **Configure AWS Credentials**
    ```bash
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your_access_key"
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your_secret_key"
   export AWS_REGION="your_preferred_region"
2. Initialize Terraform
    - terraform init
3. Review the Execution Plan
    - terraform plan
4. Apply the Configuration
    - terraform apply

State Management
This project uses remote state storage in S3 with state locking via DynamoDB for collaborative environments.

Best Practices
  - Use workspaces for managing multiple environments
  - Tag all resources appropriately
  - Use variables for reusable configurations
  - Keep sensitive data in terraform.tfvars (add to .gitignore)

Resource Management
The following AWS resources are managed in this project:

  - VPC and Networking components
  - Security Groups
  - EC2 Instances
  - S3 Buckets
  - IAM Roles and Policies

Clean Up
To remove all created resources:
  - terraform destroy

Important Notes
=============
Always review the execution plan before applying changes
Ensure proper access controls and security measures
Regularly update Terraform and provider versions
Back up your state files

Security
========
Never commit AWS credentials
Use IAM roles and policies with least privilege
Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit


This README provides a solid foundation for anyone working with Terraform on AWS. It covers essential aspects like prerequisites, setup, usage, best practices, and security considerations. You can customize it further based on your specific project needs and requirements.
